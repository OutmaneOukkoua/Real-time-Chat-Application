# Real-time Chat Application with Socket.io

This repository contains a simple real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. Users can connect to the server, exchange messages, and receive live updates when other users join or leave the chat. The application also features a typing indicator to notify users when someone is typing.

# Key Features:

WebSocket communication using Socket.io for real-time updates
Basic HTML front-end for user interaction
Broadcasting typing and stop typing events to enhance user experience
Event-driven programming model for handling connections, messages, and disconnections

# How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies with npm install.
Start the server using npm start.
Open the application in your browser and begin chatting in real-time.

# Note:

This project serves as a demonstration of event-driven programming and the implementation of real-time features using Socket.io in a Node.js environment.
